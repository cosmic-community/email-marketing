# ✅ Inngest Migration Complete!

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Send Button → Now Uses Inngest** ✅

**File:** `components/SendCampaignButton.tsx`

**Change:**

```typescript
// OLD
await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaign.id}/send`, { method: "POST" });

// NEW
await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaign.id}/send-inngest`, { method: "POST" });
```

**Result:** All manual campaign sends now use Inngest (no timeouts!)

---

### 2. **Simplified Cron Job** ✅

**New File:** `app/api/cron/check-scheduled-campaigns/route.ts`

**What it does:**

- ✅ Checks for scheduled campaigns every 2 minutes
- ✅ Triggers Inngest when send_date arrives
- ❌ Does NOT send emails directly (Inngest handles that)

**Old file:** `app/api/cron/send-campaigns/route.ts`

- ⚠️ Still exists but is NO LONGER USED
- Can be deleted after verifying everything works

---

### 3. **Inngest Scheduled Checker (Backup)** ✅

**New File:** `inngest/check-scheduled.ts`

**What it does:**

- Runs every 5 minutes via Inngest
- Double-checks for scheduled campaigns
- Provides redundancy if Vercel cron fails

**Why both Vercel cron AND Inngest cron?**

- Vercel cron (every 2 min) = fast response
- Inngest cron (every 5 min) = backup/redundancy
- If one fails, the other catches it

---

### 4. **Updated Vercel Cron Config** ✅

**File:** `vercel.json`

**Change:**

```json
// OLD
"path": "/api/cron/send-campaigns",

// NEW
"path": "/api/cron/check-scheduled-campaigns",
```

---

### 5. **Registered New Inngest Functions** ✅

**File:** `app/api/inngest/route.ts`

Now registers TWO functions:

1. `sendCampaignFunction` - Sends campaigns (triggered manually or by scheduler)
2. `checkScheduledCampaignsFunction` - Checks for scheduled campaigns every 5 min

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Manual Send (User Clicks "Send Now"):

```
1. User clicks "Send Now" button
2. Button calls /api/campaigns/[id]/send-inngest
3. Endpoint triggers Inngest event
4. Inngest processes campaign (no timeout!)
5. Progress updates in real-time
6. Campaign completes ✅
```

### Scheduled Send:

```
1. User schedules campaign for 3:00 PM
2. At 3:00 PM, Vercel cron triggers (2-min check)
3. Cron calls Inngest to start campaign
4. Inngest processes campaign (no timeout!)
5. Campaign completes ✅

BACKUP: If Vercel cron misses it:
- Inngest cron checks at 3:05 PM
- Triggers the campaign
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### ☐ Step 1: Add Environment Variables

**Required** (if not already added):

```bash
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=inngest_event_key_YOUR_KEY
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=signkey-prod-YOUR_KEY
```

**Where to add:**

1. Local `.env.local`
2. Vercel Environment Variables (Production + Preview + Development)

### ☐ Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Inngest migration - all sends use background processing"
git push
```

### ☐ Step 3: Sync Inngest

After Vercel deploys:

1. Go to [Inngest Dashboard](https://app.inngest.com)
2. Click **Apps** → **Sync App**
3. Enter: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/inngest`
4. Click **Sync**

**Verify you see TWO functions:**

- ✅ `send-campaign`
- ✅ `check-scheduled-campaigns`

### ☐ Step 4: Test

**Test Manual Send:**

1. Create a small test campaign (100 contacts)
2. Click "Send Now"
3. Verify it shows "Sending" status
4. Watch progress update in real-time
5. Check Inngest Dashboard for execution details

**Test Scheduled Send:**

1. Create a campaign
2. Schedule it for 2 minutes from now
3. Wait and watch
4. Verify it auto-starts at scheduled time
5. Check both Vercel logs and Inngest Dashboard

### ☐ Step 5: Monitor

**First 24 hours:**

- Watch a few campaigns complete
- Check Inngest Dashboard for any errors
- Verify progress updates work correctly
- Ensure scheduled campaigns trigger on time

### ☐ Step 6: Cleanup (After 1 week)

Once confident everything works:

```bash
# Delete old cron job file (no longer used)
rm app/api/cron/send-campaigns/route.ts

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Remove old cron-based campaign sending"
git push
```

## 🔍 What to Monitor

### In Inngest Dashboard:

**Check these regularly:**

- ✅ Function runs (should see campaigns processing)
- ✅ Success rate (should be >95%)
- ✅ Average execution time
- ✅ Any failed runs (investigate)

**Common issues:**

- Rate limit errors → Auto-retries, should resolve
- Database timeouts → Check Cosmic API status
- Missing env vars → Re-sync and redeploy

### In Your App:

**Check these:**

- ✅ Campaign progress updates in UI
- ✅ "Sending" status appears correctly
- ✅ Campaigns complete with "Sent" status
- ✅ Stats are accurate

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Campaign not starting?

**Check:**

1. Inngest Dashboard → Events (did event trigger?)
2. Environment variables in Vercel
3. Inngest app sync status
4. Network tab for API errors

### Campaign stuck in "Sending"?

**Check:**

1. Inngest Dashboard → Find the run
2. Look for error in specific step
3. Check Vercel logs
4. Verify Cosmic API is accessible

### Scheduled campaign not auto-starting?

**Check:**

1. Vercel Cron logs
2. Inngest Dashboard → Scheduled functions
3. Campaign send_date is in the past
4. Campaign status is "Scheduled"

### Progress not updating?

**Check:**

1. Inngest run is actually processing
2. Database connection is stable
3. Browser console for polling errors
4. Refresh the page

## 📊 System Architecture

### Before (Cron-Based):

```
Vercel Cron (every 2 min)
  → Fetches campaigns
  → Sends emails directly
  → Times out at 60s
  → Complex locking
  → Manual batching
```

### After (Inngest-Based):

```
USER TRIGGERS:
  Send Button → /api/campaigns/[id]/send-inngest → Inngest

SCHEDULED TRIGGERS:
  Vercel Cron (every 2 min) → Check scheduled → Trigger Inngest
  Inngest Cron (every 5 min) → Check scheduled → Trigger Inngest (backup)

SENDING:
  Inngest Function (no timeout)
    → Fetches contacts
    → Sends in batches
    → Updates progress
    → Completes campaign
```

## 🎊 You're All Set!

The migration is complete! Your campaign sending is now:

- ✅ Timeout-proof
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Easier to monitor
- ✅ Simpler code
- ✅ Fully redundant (dual scheduler)

**Next:** Follow the deployment checklist above and you're done! 🚀
